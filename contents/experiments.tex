\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:experiments}

In this chapter we present the results of our research. 
For this purpose, we use the tools presented in Chapter \ref{chap:impl} and the 
environment set up provided in Chapter \ref{chap:methods}.
We briefly describe the tasks we face respectively in Sections \ref{sec:task1} and 
\ref{sec:task2}, and then we proceed with the evaluation of the results of the 
experiments.

Throughout the experiments we compare different models, varying the input of 
the network, either \texttt{prox\_values}, \texttt{prox\_comm} or 
\texttt{all\_sensors}, the number of agents and the average gap between them, 
either fixed to a certain value or variable.
