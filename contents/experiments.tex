%\section{Overview}
%\label{sec:overview}

In this work we investigate collaborative multi-agent problems in a \gls{1d} 
simulated environment.

The environment is represent by a Cartesian plane, a system of coordinates
defined by two perpendicular axis, $x$ and $y$. 

In this scenario, $N$ robots, all oriented in the same direction, are initially 
randomly placed along the x-axis, avoiding collisions and in such a way the 
average gap among the agents is included in the proximity sensors' ranges. 
All the robots act in collaboration to achieve a common goal, however the first 
and last in the row behave like walls. %% FIXME

The agent is a point in the plane, formally described by an homogeneous vector 
with respect to the world coordinate frame $W$, obtained multiplying the 
homogeneous vector of the point, with respect to the robot coordinate frame 
$A$, by an homogeneous transformation. 

The relative pose $A$ of each agent is identified by a $3 \times 3$ matrix 
$\mathbf{T}$, with respect to the world reference frame $W$. 

\begin{Equation}[!htb]
	\centering
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:homogeneous transformation matrix}
	{^W\!\xi_A} = {^W\!\mathbf{T}_A} 
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	^W\!\mathbf{R}_A & ^W\!\mathbf{t}_A\\
	0, 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\cos \theta & - \sin \theta & t_x\\
	\sin \theta & \cos \theta & t_y\\
	0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}
	\caption[Homogeneous Transformation Matrix]{The homogeneous 
	transformation matrix, 	$^W\!\mathbf{T}_A$, includes $^W\!\mathbf{R}_A$, a 
	$2 \times 2$ rotation matrix and $^W\!\mathbf{t}_A$, a $2 \times 1$ 
	translation vector.}
	\label{eq:hommatrix}
\end{Equation}

However, since we are in a \gls{1d} environment, the $y$ coordinate is equal 
to $0$ and also the orientation angle $\theta$ must be zero as all the agents are 
oriented as the world frame. 

Moreover, we can consider the agents as holonomic, since their movements are 
limited in only one dimension. This premise simplifies our system, in which 
consequently we have to keep into account only geometric constraints and not
kinematic.
