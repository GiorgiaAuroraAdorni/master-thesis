\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

In this work we investigate collaborative multi-agent problems in a \gls{1d} 
simulated environment.

The environment is represent by a Cartesian plane, a system of coordinates
defined by two perpendicular axis, $x$ and $y$. 

In this scenario, $N$ robots are initially randomly placed along the x-axis, 
avoiding collisions, all oriented in the same direction. All the agents act in 
collaboration to achieve a common goal, however the first and last robot in the 
row behave like walls. \text{FIXME}

The location of each agent in the plane is given by its coordinates $(x, y)$, while 
the orientation by the angle $\theta$, both expressed with respect to the world 
reference frame, with origin in $(0, 0)$.

The relative pose of each agent is formally described by a 3x3 homogeneous 
transformation matrix containing the position $(x, y)$ and the orientation angle 
$\theta$. 

However, since we are in a \gls{1d} environment, the $y$ coordinate will be equal 
to $0$ and because all the agents are oriented as the world frame, also $\theta$ 
must be zero. 
For these reasons, we will 'informally' use only the $x$ coordinate. 
Moreover, we can consider the agents as holonomic, since their movements are 
limited in only one dimension. This premise simplifies our system, in which 
consequently we have to keep into account only geometric constraints and not
kinematic.
