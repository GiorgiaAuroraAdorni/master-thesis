\subsection{Distributed approach}
\label{subsec:ex1distr}

\subsubsection{Model training}
\label{subsubsec:learneddist}

Once, enough data are collected through the simulator by using the optimal 
controller, it is possible to train a very simplified ``distributed network'' 
that takes as input an array containing the response values of the sensors – 
which can be either \texttt{prox\_values}, \texttt{prox\_comm} or 
\texttt{all\_sensors} – and produces as output an array containing one float 
that represents the speed of the wheels, which is assumed to be the same 
both right and left.

The dataset then contains a fixed number of simulation runs, each of these 
composed by a variable quantity of time steps. It is important to notice that 
for this approach, unlike the one with communication, it is not necessary to 
keep the order of the sequence of time steps, neither to know the exact 
number of agents in the simulation since the network input is the sensing 
associated to a single robot.

For this reason, the model is independent of the number of agents and 
consequently it is possible to prove its generalisation capacity, regardless 
the number of robots, by training the networks first on datasets each with a 
different but fixed value of $N$ and then on simulations composed by a 
variable $N$.
It is easy to show that although the value of $N$ changes the network 
structure does not, as it is sufficient during the input preprocessing to 
change the dimension of the input in such a way that all the tensors have 
the same length, fixed at the maximum possible value of $N$, padding 
those tensors with a lower number of agents.

Thanks to these two assumptions, it is possible to shuffle the original 
dataset, based on the single run, in order to improve the generalisation on 
the samples, and then split the resulting collection into the train, the 
validation and the test sets, containing respectively $60$-$20$-$20\%$ of 
the data. 

The architecture of the network, displayed in Figure 
\ref{fig:singlenetdistributed1}, is straightforward: there are three linear 
layers each of size $\langle\mathtt{input\_size}, 10\rangle$,  $\langle 10, 
10\rangle$ and $\langle 10, 1\rangle$, where \texttt{input\_size} is the 
shape of the sensing, that can be $7$ or $14$.

	inputs.}
	\label{fig:singlenetdistributed1}
\end{figure}
To the first and second layer is applied a non-linear activation function, 
useful to make the model generalise. 
In particular, we chose the hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) 
\cite[see][]{kalman1992}, a zero-centred function, shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:tanh}, whose range lies between $[-1, 1]$ and its output is given by

\begin{Equation}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{equation}
	f(x)= \frac{\sinh (x)}{\cosh (x)} = \bigg( \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + 
		e^{-x}}\bigg)
	\end{equation}
	\caption{Hyperbolic Tangent Function (Tanh).}
	\label{eq:tanh}
\end{Equation}

This type of activation function is often used in deep learning and one of its 
advantages is that negative inputs are mapped to strongly negative values.

	Tangent Function (Tanh ) applied as non-linear activation to the first and the 
	second layer of the network.}
	\label{fig:tanh}
\end{figure}

As optimiser, we chose Adam, {an algorithm for first-order gradient-based 
optimisation of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of 
lower-order moments}, \cite[see][]{kingma2014adam, 
loshchilov2017decoupled}, 
implemented in the \texttt{torch.optim} package, with a learning rate of $0.01$. 

Instead of computing the gradient descent on the entire dataset, the training set is 
split in mini-batches of size $100$ and an approximation of the gradient is 
produced, which makes the algorithm faster and at the same time, for sufficiently 
large numbers, the result is indistinguishable.

Gradient descent algorithms are susceptible to ``get stuck'' in local minima.
Mini-batches shuffle facilitate to avoid this problem by enabling the gradient to 
``bounce'' out of eventual local minimum, making it more variable by exploiting 
randomness, thereby helping convergence.

All the models are trained for $50$ epochs and evaluated using the \gls{mse} loss 
function, often used in regression problems. 
This criterion, implemented in the \texttt{torch.nn} package, measures the 
average of squared error between predictions and targets and learns to reduce it 
by penalising big errors in the model predictions.

\begin{Equation}[!htb]

	\begin{equation}
	\mathtt{MSE} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\hat y_i)^2}{n}

\subsubsection{Experiments}
\label{subsubsec:expdist}

The first group of experiments carried out, summarised in Table 
\ref{tab:modeln5dist}, examines the behaviour of the control learned in the case 
of the three different inputs, \texttt{prox\_values}, \texttt{prox\_comm} or 
\texttt{all\_sensors}, for a number of robots $N$ and an \texttt{avg\_gap} both 
fixed respectively at $5$ and the second chosen between $8$, $13$ and $24$.

	\end{tabular}
	\captionof{table}[Experiments with $5$ agents (no communication).]{List of the 
	experiments carried out with $5$ agents.}
	\label{tab:modeln5dist}
\end{figure}

First of all we start by showing in Figure \ref{fig:distloss} an overview of the 
models performance in terms of train and validation losses. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{contents/images/task1/loss-distributed-all@}%
	\caption[Comparison of losses of the first set of 
	experiments.]{Comparison of 
	the losses of the models carried out with $5$ agents.}
	\label{fig:distloss}
\end{figure}
It is immediately evident that, in case of \texttt{prox\_values} inputs, the 
experiment performed with an \texttt{avg\_gap} of $24$ is not remarkable since 
this value exceeds the maximal range of the sensor. In fact, from this analysis we 
generally expect a more stable behaviour using both types of input together, i.e. 
\texttt{all\_sensors}.

We start the analysis by exploring the results of the experiments obtained 
using the \texttt{prox\_values} readings alone as input of the network, continuing 
the with \texttt{prox\_comm} and concluding with \texttt{all\_sensors}.
The performance of \texttt{net-d1} are shown in the following images. In 
particular, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d1r2} is visualised a comparison of the \gls{r2}, 
or coefficient of determination, of the manual and the learned controllers, on the 
validation set.
This score function evidences how well the regression predictions approximate 
the real data points (groundtruth). Since a model which perfectly predicts the data 
has a score of $1$, we assume that a higher score corresponds to a model that 
performs better.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.49\textwidth}

	the \gls{r2} coefficient of the manual and the controller learned from

	\label{fig:net-d1r2}
\end{figure}
From these figures we expect that the robots' behaviour using the learned 
controller instead of the manual one is a bit better, even if far from the omniscient 
controller.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d1traj} we show first a comparison of the expert and the 
learned trajectories, and then between the manual and the learned ones. In 
particular, on the y-axis is visualised the position of each agent over time, while 
on the x-axis the simulation time steps. It is important to notice that the plots 
summarise all the runs: at each time step, the position of each agent is presented 
as an average over all the simulation runs, and besides is shown this average 
minus and plus the standard deviation.

	\label{fig:net-d1traj}
\end{figure}
The convergence of the robots to the target using the omniscient controller is 
much faster that with the manual or the learned one. Generally the learned 
trajectories require a higher number of time steps to converge to the correct 
configuration, sometimes even $40$ may be necessary, compared to the two 
others controllers that need less than $10$ time steps.

Indeed, analysing in Figure \ref{fig:net-d1control} the evolution of the control 
over time, it is possible to notice that the omniscient in the first time steps uses a 
higher speed than that chosen by the manual controller or the one predicted by 
the network. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]

		of output control decided using three controllers: the expert, the manual 
		and the one learned from \texttt{net-d1}.}
	\label{fig:net-d1control}
\end{figure}
After about $10$ time steps the expert reaches the target while the manual need 
about $15$ time steps to arrive to the goal with a certain tolerance, maintaining 
then the speed constant at $0$. Instead, the distributed controller decreases the 
speed of the agents as the time steps pass, reaching zero speed but with a certain 
variance.

A couple of useful plots are shown below. In Figure 
\ref{fig:net-d1responsesensors} is visualised the response of the learned 
controller as the input sensing changes. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.49\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{contents/images/net-d1/response-net-d1-front}%

	\caption[Response of \texttt{net-d1} by varying the input sensing.]{Response of 
		\texttt{net-d1} by varying the input sensing.}
	\label{fig:net-d1responsesensors}
\end{figure}
In particular we analyse two cases. The first one shows the control predicted by 
the network when the robot sees nothing behind but only in front, more 
specifically when the given input is  $([0, 0, x, 0, 0, 0, 0])$, with $x$ varying in the 
range $[0, 4500]$.
The second shows the control predicted by the network when the robot instead 
sees nothing in front but only behind, more specifically when the given input is  
$([0, 0, 0, 0, 0,x , x])$, with $x$ varying in the range $[0, 4500]$.
The behaviour is almost as expected. When the robot sees nothing behind but 
something in front, the model returns a negative speed, since the robot has to 
move backwards. 
The absolute value of control increases as the proximity to the obstacle increases.
A complementary behaviour is obtained when the robot sees only behind but 
not in front.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{contents/images/net-d1/response-varying_init_position-distributed}%
	\caption{Response of \texttt{net-d1} by varying the initial position.}
	\label{fig:net-d1responseposition}
\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:net-d1responseposition} is displayed the behaviour of a robot 
located between two stationary agents which are already in their place, showing 
the response of the controllers, on the y-axis, by varying the position of the 
moving robot, visualised on the x-axis. The output control is computed as an 
average over $100$ measures in which the pose of the agent $(x, y, \theta)$ 
differs by a certain epsilon uniformly distributed in the range $[-0.5, 0.5]$, thus 
to avoid the effects of noise that would be obtained on a single measurement and 
unrealistic artefacts in which the sensors are not continuous. Besides, are shown 
the bands which represent plus and minus standard deviation. As expected, the 
output is a high value, positive or negative respectively when the robot is close to 
an obstacle on the left or on the right, or it is close to $0$ when the distance from 
right and left is equal.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{contents/images/net-d1/distances-from-goal-compressed-distributed}%
	\caption[Evaluation of \texttt{net-d1} distances from goal.]{Comparison of 
		performance in terms of distances from goal obtained using three 
		controllers: 
		the expert, the manual and the one learned from \texttt{net-d1}.}
	\label{fig:net-d1distance}
\end{figure}

Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d1distance} is presented another useful metric that 
measures the absolute distance of each robot from the target, visualised on the 
y-axis, over time. This value is averaged on all robots among all the simulation 
runs. The median value is shown as well as the interquartile and interdecile ranges.
On average, the distance from goal of the learned controller is lower than the one 
obtained with the manual controller, meaning that in the final configuration 
the robots moved following the learned controller are closer to the target than 
those moved with the manual one, which are on average at a distance of about 
$1$\gls{cm} from the goal position. 

As mentioned before, in case of \texttt{prox\_values} inputs the 
experiment performed with an \texttt{avg\_gap} of $24$ is not meaningful since 
this value exceeds the maximal range of the sensor. Similarly, since $14$ is the 
maximum range, it is difficult to use this type of input when the \texttt{avg\_gap}  
is $13$, as shown by the losses in Figure \ref{fig:distlossprox_values}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{contents/images/task1/loss-distributed-prox_values@}%
	\caption{Comparison of the losses of the models that use \texttt{prox\_values} 
		readings.}
	\label{fig:distlossprox_values}
\end{figure}

Following are shown the results of the experiments obtained using the 
\texttt{prox\_comm} readings. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{contents/images/task1/loss-distributed-prox_comm@}%
	\caption{Comparison of the losses of the models that use \texttt{prox\_comm} 
		readings.}
	\label{fig:distlossprox_comm}
\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:distlossprox_comm}, are analysed the losses by varying the 
average gap. From a first observation the network seems to be able to work with 
all the gaps.

Examining the \gls{r2} coefficients in Figure \ref{fig:net-d456r2}, the higher 
value is obtained with \texttt{net-d6}. For the assumptions made before we 
believe that this model is more promising. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\label{fig:net-d6r2}
\end{figure}

Moreover, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:net-d6r2}, we expect that the robots’ 
behaviour using the learned instead of the manual controller is better, even if far 
from the expert.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d6traj} are shown the trajectories obtained employing the 
three controllers.

\end{figure}
As before, the robot positions are averaged over all the runs. 
Even for the expert, the convergence to the target is slower than before, 
as expected since the distance between the robots is greater, but it is much faster 
than with the other two controllers.
The manual controller has serious problems in reaching the goal: even if the 
agents try to position themselves at equal distances, they tend to increase the 
average gap between them, creating situations in which the last robot in motion 
hits the fixed one. 
Surprisingly, the learned controller allows the agents to converge to the correct 
configuration by taking more time than the expert does.

An immediate examination of the evolution of the control over time, in Figure 
\ref{fig:net-d6control}, highlights the speed of the expert controller, which in all 
the simulation runs after $25$ time steps has reached the goal. 
In addition, the manual controller always sets a positive speed, which leads to the 
wrong behaviour mentioned earlier, while the slowness of the distributed 
control is explained by the use of a low speed.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:net-d6responsesensors} visualises the response of the learned 
controller as the input sensing changes, analysing the same two cases as before. 
Despite the behaviour is the same obtained using \texttt{prox\_values} when the 
robot sees only behind, this time the trend is different when the robot sees 
nothing behind: since the robot has to move backwards, a negative speed is 
always returned, that is higher when the obstacle is far.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d6responseposition} is displayed the behaviour of a robot 
located between two that are already in their place.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{contents/images/net-d6/response-varying_init_position-distributed}%
	\caption{Response of \texttt{net-d6} by varying the initial position.}
	\label{fig:net-d6responseposition}
\end{figure}
It visualises the response of the learned controller by varying the distance 
between two stationary agents and a robot located among them.
As expected, the output is a high positive value when the robot is close to an 
obstacle on the left, it decreases and reaches $0$ when the distance from 
right and left is equal, and finally becomes negative when there is an obstacle in 
front and not behind. 

Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d6distance} is presented the average distance of the 
robots from the target among all the simulations. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\label{fig:net-d6distance}
\end{figure}
The performance of the learned and the manual controllers are similar: in the 
final configuration they both are at about $5$\gls{cm} from the target. 

We conclude the first group of experiments presenting the results obtained 
using both types of input together from which we expect a more stable and 
robust behaviour. 
In Figure \ref{fig:distlossall} an analysis of the losses shows that using 
\texttt{all\_sensors} inputs the network is able to work well with all the 
gaps.

Examining the \gls{r2} coefficients in Figure \ref{fig:net-d789r2}, the behaviour 
obtained with \texttt{net-d7} and \texttt{net-d9} are the more promising.

Considering the more complex case, that is the one with the greatest average gap,
the superiority of this controller is further supported by the comparisons in Figure
\ref{fig:net-d9r2}.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d9traj} are shown trajectories obtained employing the three 
controllers. The convergence to the target is still slow, even if this time the expert 
need less time steps than before. 
The manual controller does not shows the same problem has before, while the 
learned controller is still the slowest to end up in the correct configuration.

Examining the evolution of the output control, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d9control}, 
the plots of the expert and the learned controller are similar, although the speed 
in the second is much lower.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d9responseposition} is displayed the behaviour of a robot 
located between two that are already in their place.

\end{figure}
This time the trend of the three curves shows how the behaviour of the model 
learned and of the manual controller are similar to that of the expert.

Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d9distance} is presented the absolute distance of 
each robot from the target, averaged on all robots among all the simulation runs. 
The median value is shown as well as the interquartile and interdecile ranges.

\end{figure}
As anticipated by the trajectories in Figure \ref{fig:net-d9traj}, the controller 
learned from \texttt{net-d9} is slower to converge than the manual one. In fact, 
this plot confirms that the agents moved following a manual controller in the final 
configuration are closer to the target than those moved by the distributed 
controller, respectively, they are on average $2$ or $7$\gls{cm} away from the 
goal position.

	\label{fig:distloss81324}
\end{figure}
To summarise the performance, as the different inputs of the network vary, for 
each gap, we show once again in the figures below the losses of the trained 
models. In all the figures the blue line represents the loss using 
\texttt{prox\_values} as input, in orange \texttt{prox\_comm} and finally in green 
\texttt{all\_sensors}.
In case of an \texttt{avg\_gap} of $8$\gls{cm}, the model trained using 
\texttt{prox\_values} as input has a lower loss, following is the network that 
employ \texttt{all\_sensors}, with a very similar value, and at the end the model 
that works with \texttt{prox\_comm}.
It is quite obvious that the performance obtained using as inputs 
\texttt{prox\_values} and \texttt{all\_sensors} are the best, as well as the fact that 
\texttt{all\_sensors} cannot perform better than the other since using also the 
data coming from \texttt{prox\_comm}, that is not able to work well with small 
gaps, contains in the second half of the array unusable values.
In a complementary way, by increasing the gap to $13$\gls{cm},  
\texttt{prox\_values} alone is not able to achieve satisfactory results, while used 
together with \texttt{prox\_comm}, \texttt{all\_sensors} reaches good 
performances that on the validation set are comparable to those obtained using 
\texttt{prox\_comm} alone.
Finally, by increasing the gap even more, up to $24$\gls{cm}, 
\texttt{prox\_values} becomes completely unusable, while \texttt{prox\_comm} 
and \texttt{all\_sensors} still have excellent performances similar to each other.

The last group of experiments we carried out using a distributed approach, 
examines the behaviour of the control learned just in case of \texttt{all\_sensors} 
inputs. On this occasion the simulation runs use a different number of robots $N$, 
that can be fixed at $5$ or $8$ for the entire simulation, or even vary in the range 
$[5, 10]$. The same reasoning is applied for the choice of the \texttt{avg\_gap}, 
that can be a fixed value in all the runs, chosen between $8$ or $20$, but also 
vary in the range $[5, 24]$. 
The objective of this set of experiments, summarised in Table \ref{tab:modeldist}, 
is verify the robustness of the models, proving that it is possible to train networks 
that use a variable number of agents.

First of all we start by showing in Figure \ref{fig:distlossext} an overview of the 
models performance in terms of train and validation losses and in Figure 
\ref{fig:distlossn5} an analysis on the experiments performed using a fixed 
number of agents, the same used for the group of experiments presented above, 
i.e. $5$, in order to show the difference of performance using a gap that is first 
small, then large and finally variable.

Examining more in detail the case in which the model is trained using a 
variable average gap, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d12r2} is visualised a comparison of 
the \gls{r2} of the manual and the learned controllers, on the validation set.

\end{figure}
The robots' behaviour using the learned instead of the manual controller is a 
bit better, even if far from the expert.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d12traj} we show first a comparison of the expert and the 
learned trajectories, and then between the manual and the learned ones. 
In particular, on the y-axis is visualised the position of each agent over time, 
averaged over all the simulation runs, while on the x-axis the simulation 
time steps. 

It is important to note that there is a difference in these graphs compared to 
those of the previous group of experiments. Observing the deviation of the 
position of the robots with respect to the average, the last agent of the row did 
not maintain the same initial and goal positions throughout the simulations since 
the average gap set is different for every run.
The convergence of the robots to the target is guaranteed in 20 time steps using 
the expert, while the manual and learned controller still manage to reach the 
correct configuration with more time.

Analysing the evolution of the control over time, in Figure 
\ref{fig:net-d12control}, we observe that the speeds set by the manual controller 
and the one learned from the network are significantly lower and therefore do 
not allow to reach the target in a satisfactory time.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d12responseposition} another informative plot displays 
the behaviour of a robot located between two that are already in their place.
As expected, the trend of the three curves shows how the behaviour of the 
model learned and of the manual controller are similar.

Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d12distance} is shown the absolute distance of 
each robot from the target, averaged on all robots among all the simulation runs, 
over time. 
Despite we expected performances similar to those presented in the Figure 
\ref{fig:net-d9distance}, in this circumstance the agents moved following the 
distributed controller are closer to the target, in particular in the final 
configuration they are on average $2$\gls{cm} away from the goal position. 
Furthermore, it is shown that there are far fewer cases far from average 
behaviour.

\end{figure}

Following are shown the losses of the models trained using an higher number of 
agents, i.e. 8, by varying the average gap.
In Figure \ref{fig:distlossprox_comm}, are analysed. From a first observation 
the network seems to be able to work with all the gaps.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{contents/images/task1-extension/loss-distributed-n8@}%
	\caption{Comparison of the losses of the models that use $8$ agents as

	\label{fig:distlossn8}
\end{figure}
As before, for the network it is easier to perform a task using a smaller gap.
For this reason, it is more interesting to analyse the case in which the model 
is trained using a variable gap.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d15r2} is visualised a comparison of the \gls{r2} 
coefficients of the manual and the learned controller. In both cases, the 
coefficients are very low, since in most of

\noindent
the cases in which the controllers have to decide a zero or maximum speed a 
wrong value is predicted, however, the coefficient obtained from the network is 
slightly better.

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d15traj} are shown the trajectories obtained employing 
the three controllers.

Compared to the previous case, a greater number of robots implies a 
slowdown in reaching the correct position, even when using an expert 
controller.
As before, the convergence of the robots using the manual and learned 
controllers needs more time.

Examining in Figure \ref{fig:net-d15control} the evolution of the control over 
time, the graph of the distributed controller highlights how the speed decided by 
the model has further decreased due to the increase in the amount of agents in 
the simulation.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d15responseposition} is displayed the behaviour of a robot 
located between two that are already in their place.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{contents/images/net-d15/response-varying_init_position-distributed}%

	\label{fig:net-d15responseposition}
\end{figure}
Analysing the way of acting of the three controllers for this experiment, from 
the plot arises an important difference in the decisions taken by the distributed 
and the manual controllers.
The learned controller, whether a robot is closer to the one that precedes it 
or to the one following it, sets a proportional speed, lower than the optimal one, 
that leads it to move respectively back and forth to reach the desired position.
Instead, the manual controller when an agent is closer to the one in front 
sets a very high speed to move quickly to the desired position, just like the expert 
does, unlike when the robot is closer to the one following it, where it sets a 
negative speed but not high enough, a bit like the distributed controller does.

Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d15distance} is presented the average distance of 
the robots from the target among all the simulations. The performance of the 
learned and the manual controllers 
\begin{figure}[H]

	of performance in terms of distances from goal obtained using three 
	controllers: the expert, the manual and the one learned from \texttt{net-d15}.}

\end{figure}

\noindent
are different from before: \texttt{net-d15} is slower to converge. In fact, this plot 
confirms that the agents moved following a manual controller in the final 
configuration are closer to the target than those moved by the distributed 
controller, respectively, they are on average $2$ or $3.5$\gls{cm} away from the 
goal position. Moreover, observing the coloured bands we see that there is a lot of 
variance in the distributed controller final positions, in fact there are runs in which 
some agents can be even $10$\gls{cm} far from the target.

We conclude the experiments performed using a distributed approach by 
presenting the results obtained with a number of agents variable. 
In Figure \ref{fig:distlossnvar}, are analysed the losses by varying the average 
gap. As before, for the network it is easier to perform a task using a smaller gap 
and in general training the model on a variable gap performs better than on a 
fixed but big gap.

Dwelling on the most interesting case, the one in with both average gap and 
number of agents variable, the \gls{r2} coefficients shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:net-d18r2} are still very low.

Since the number of agents is variable, we show different plots, depending on this 
quantity, for the trajectories obtained employing the three controllers: we analyse 
the cases with 5, 8 and 10 agents respectively in Figures \ref{fig:net-d18traj5}, 
\ref{fig:net-d18traj8} and \ref{fig:net-d18traj10}.

\noindent
From a first observation it is confirmed that increasing the number of robots in 
the simulation implies a greater number of time steps to reach the final 
configuration.
Furthermore, with a large number of agents it is common for biases to add up 
and for the error to become more significant, in particular the one of the central 
robot of the group.
The convergence is still slow, even if this time the expert need less time steps than 
before. The learned controller is still the slowest to end up in the correct 
configuration.

Examining the evolution of the output control, in Figure \ref{fig:net-d18control}, 
the graph of the distributed controller highlights how the speed decided by the 
model has decreased due to the increase in the amount of agents in the 
simulation.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:net-d18responseposition} is displayed the behaviour of a robot 
located between two that are already in their place.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{contents/images/net-d18/response-varying_init_position-distributed}%
	\caption{Response of \texttt{net-d18} by varying the initial position.}
	\label{fig:net-d18responseposition}
\end{figure}
In this case the same reasoning made for Figure 
\ref{fig:net-d15responseposition} apply.

Focusing on the absolute distance of each robot from the target, presented in 
Figure \ref{fig:net-d18distance}, we observe once again that the agents moved 
following a manual controller in the final configuration are closer to the target 
than those moved with the learned one.

	\label{fig:net-d18distance}
\end{figure}

To summarise the performance, as the number of agents vary for each gap, we 
show once again in the figures below the losses of the trained models.
In case of an \texttt{avg\_gap} of $8$\gls{cm}, the model trained using 
a minor number of agents, as expected has a lower loss, following, with very 
similar values the model that employ 8 robots and that with a variable number of 
agents.
Finally, by choosing a variable gap and number of agents the performance are 
better than those generated with fixed but high number of robots. While again, 
the results obtained using fewer agents are the best.

\subsubsection{Summary}
\label{subsubsec:summary}
In this section we have shown that using a distributed controller learned by 
imitating an expert it is possible to obtain results more or less comparable to 
those reached employing a manual controller.
However, this approach is not enough to achieve satisfactory performance. In the 
following section we are going to describe a second approach that solve the 
problem by exploiting a communication protocol between agents.
