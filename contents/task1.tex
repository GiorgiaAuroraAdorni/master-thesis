\section{Task 1: Distributing the robots in space}
\label{sec:task1}

The first scenario tackles an interesting multi-agent coordination task, 
distributing the robots in space in such a way they stand at equal distances 
from each other. In particular, they have arrange themselves uniformly along the 
line between the two ``dead'' robots.

We focus on two approaches to solve to problem, one distributed that act in a 
supervised way in order to predict the target velocity of the agents, and one that 
in addition to predict the control infers a communication protocol between the 
agents. 

In both cases, we train \glspl{dnn} that receive sensor inputs and produce 
commands for the motors, but for the second alternative, the network has an 
addition input – the received communication transmitted by the neighbouring 
agents in the previous timestep – and an extra output – the message to be sent.
