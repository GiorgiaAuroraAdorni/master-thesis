\section{Task 1: Distributing of robots in space}
\label{sec:task1}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{subsec:desc1}

The first scenario tackles an interesting multi-agent coordination task, 
Distributing the robots in space.

As described in the overview of Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}, which provides 
additional details, are spawned in a ``single file'' N robots at random positions.
Each agent can update its state – its absolute position – by performing actions – 
moving forward and backwards along the x-axis – based on the observations 
received from the environment – the distances from neighbours – using its 
sensors. They are also able to transmit and receive a communication value to 
peer robots within a range of about $48$\gls{cm}. 
A full explanation of how communication works for Thymio II is covered in 
Section \ref{subsec:thymiocomm}.

As a consequence of the \gls{1d} environment, the agents' movements are 
limited to two directions: moving forward along the x-axis when the velocity is 
positive, while going backwards when it is negative. 

The robots share a common goal: arrange themselves uniformly along the 
line between the two ``dead'' robots, in such a way they stand at equal distances 
from each other.

This problem represents a cooperative goal that can be reached by performing 
imitation learning, that means training an end-to-end \gls{nn} by following 
the example of an omniscient controller, introduced in Section 
\ref{subsubsec:omniscient}.
Exploiting its complete knowledge of the environment, the expert is able to 
decide the best action to perform.

In the course of this study, we tried to understand if it is possible to use a 
controller learned by imitation, instead of using a manual one. In particular, we 
focus on two approaches, presented in Sections \ref{subsec:dist} and 
\ref{subsec:comm}.
In both cases, we train \glspl{dnn} that receive sensor inputs and produce 
commands for the motors, but for the second alternative, the network has an 
addition input – the received communication transmitted by the neighbouring 
agents in the previous timestep – and an extra output – the message to be sent.

\subsection{Controllers}
\label{subsec:task1controllers}

\subsubsection{Expert controller}
\label{subsubsec:omniscient}

As disclosed in Section \ref{subsec:controllersmodel}, the first element involved in 
an imitation learning problem is the omniscient controller, also called expert.

This controller perceives the environment and the observations of all the agents, 
obtaining a global knowledge of the state of the system. In this way it can use all 
the information that it owns to decide the best action to perform for all the 
agents. 



\subsubsection{Manual controller}
\label{subsubsec:manual}
The second controller we want to discuss/write about is the manual one, whose 
main purpose is to draw conclusions about the quality of the controller learned.

The main difference between this and the previous controller is that, the manual 
one can be considered a local distributed controller, that only has a partial 
knowledge of the environment since knows only the state of the current agent 
and its observations.
