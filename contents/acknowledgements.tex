I would like to thank my supervisors Alessandro Giusti and Jérôme Guzzi for their 
precious advice and help, my family who have never stopped believing in me and 
to Elia who shared with me this extraordinary journey, always encouraging and 
supporting me, despite all the difficulties.

A special thank goes also to Università della Svizzera Italiana and the University of 
Milano–Bicocca for allowing me to take part in this double degree program and 
to all those people who have accompanied me and made this experience special.
